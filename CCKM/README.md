## CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager (CCKM)

> CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager (CCKM) is one of the products available within CipherTrust Manager. It was previously offered as a standalone product, but it is now embedded into CipherTrust Manager and referred to as Embedded CCKM. CCKM simplifies key management in cloud environments by enabling centralised control of encryption keys across various cloud service providers. It supports a wide range of providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and more.

In this section of my notes, I will demonstrate how to use CCKM with various cloud providers.
